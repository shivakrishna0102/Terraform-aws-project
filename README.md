## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed locally.
- AWS account credentials configured, either through AWS CLI or environment variables.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-infrastructure.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd terraform-aws-infrastructure
```

## Configuration

1. Open the `variables.tf` file to review and customize the variables according to your requirements. Adjust settings such as AWS region, instance types, subnet CIDRs, and more.

2. If necessary, create a `terraform.tfvars` file to set values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`. This file should not be committed to version control as it may contain sensitive information.

3. Review the `main.tf` file, where you can find the Terraform configurations for creating AWS resources.

## Usage

Initialize your Terraform working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

Plan the infrastructure changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the changes to create the AWS resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

After successfully applying the changes, Terraform will display the created resources and their details.

## Terraform Commands

Here are some common Terraform commands you may need:

- `terraform init`: Initialize the Terraform working directory.
- `terraform plan`: Preview the changes before applying them.
- `terraform apply`: Apply the changes to create or update resources.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroy all resources managed by Terraform (use with caution).

## Destroying Resources

To destroy the created AWS resources and clean up:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
